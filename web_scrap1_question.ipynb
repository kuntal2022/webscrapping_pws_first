    "### Webscraping:\n",
    ">Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. There are many different ways to perform web scraping to obtain data from websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### It Helps:\n",
    ">Web scraping helps fetch data (like emails, phone numbers, articles, etc.) from web pages and organize it into certain formats like Excel, CSV or HTML, etc. See how Wikipedia explains web scraping: “The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 Areas\n",
    "* In the retail industry\n",
    "> There are various ways through which data from web scraping can be used in the retail industry. For example, it can be used in competitor price monitoring since manually tracking prices can be tedious and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  In financial research\n",
    "> The applications of web scraping can also extend to the financial field. In this case, data from web scraping is used in market data aggregation to yield meaningful intelligence of equity research. Moreover, it’s also used for extracting financial statements to evaluate the health of an enterprise and offer advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Data Science\n",
    "> Data science also uses web scraping to yield accurate time analytics to offer timely insights as they are needed.\n",
    "In fact, the real-time score is also essential for financial institutions as they can quickly make decisions on credit matters. It also helps with predictive analysis and natural language processing.\n",
